ART 410 - Day 3
=======================================

1. Go over Design of Everyday Things Chap. 1
2. Discuss content and mappings for Project 1
3. Fill out Objectives surveys
4. User Flows


PREP
---------------------------------------
- Load up list of UX No-No's from previous class to have ready for quiz questions
- Post Survey to blog (???)
- Post 3x3 template to blog



CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Quiz
Based on last class' discussions and 
- What are some of the things that we have to consider when designing for mobile? (context, touch screen, additional smart phone features)
- What can you do to make a good mobile UX? (Clear, intuitive, automation, progressive disclosure, consistency)
- Bad? (clutter, complexity)
- From the reading, what is the Principle of Mapping? (a clear relationship between a UI and the results, eg. the car stereo, steering wheel)
- What is a Conceptual Model? (using existing patterns to define how interactions *work*. Bad example: refrigerator thermostat)






### Discuss Reading
*The Psychopathology of Everyday Things*

- Affordances
	- The door
	- Bad: The projector (only one button to do two functions)
	- Good: The phone vs. the car (one button per function in the car)
	- What about digital? Show examples from [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=product%20design) (product design and UI design)

Talk about the many kinds of affordances as mentioned at [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/24/affordance-most-underrated-word-in-web-design/):
	- Explicit (Click here...)
	- Pattern (recognizable icons or conventions)
	- Hidden (requires hover or non-standard interaction to use, such as Clear)
	- False (appears to be an affordance but it's not, or it does something you wouldn't expect)
	- Negative (Shows that an action can not be made, such as a disabled button)
	
- Provide a Good Conceptual Model
	- The refrigerator
		
- Make Things Visible
	- Feedback
	- Make affordances clear

- Mapping 
	- Car Stereo System (balance and fade controls)
		- How could we map the speaker system in the car to be more usuable?
	
- Feedback
	- Sidetone in a phone to help regulate how loud you are talking

- Other deas to discuss
	- Wood implies opacity, sturdiness, carving. Glass implies visibility and space, and breaking
	- "Whenever the number of possible actions exceeds the number of controls, there is apt to be difficulty."
	- The usability of the floppy disk





### Discuss HW
- What sort of content did everybody collect?
- Did anybody find a competing app that was intended for just about everyone?
- What about apps that were intended for very specific groups of users?
- Lots of features? Very few features? How did this affect them?
- Who is your target audience?




### Group Discussions on Project 1 Ideas

10 minutes per student, 2 to explain, 8 to disucss.

### BREAK ###





### User Flows

- Go over [a shorthand for designing UI flows](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)

- Have students read [Keeping the goal in sight while designing component flows](http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows)

- Discuss:
	- What was Ryan Singer trying to do on the website (ie. What was his objective?)? (to watch a video online)
	- What was the website he was using try to get him to do (ie. What was the site's implied objective)? (to have users log in or create accounts)
	- How did Ryan propose solving it? (Instead of having user reset password, just send a verification email to the user, then let them proceed from there straight to the video)
	- What did he see as the core reason that the site didn't do this to begin with? (Basic requirements are set out, and then split for separate people to tackle. UX and user flow were separated)


- Take what you learned and now lets make some user flows (20 minutes)




### 3x3 Idea Distillation
Based on [Write better walkthroughs with the 3x3 Method](https://medium.com/@tomcavill/3x3-d6202ef7d077)

- Have students explain to a n00b what the product is and why they should use it. 3 illustrations, each with 3 words accompanying them. In these three columns, explain what, why and how.

What — what does your product do?
Why — what’s the benefit? (makes for a good slogan).
How — a differentiator. Perhaps an innovative piece of functionality or a cost indicator.




#### Wrap Up
- What are some of your objectives?
- Look at each step of your user flow now. Does each lead the user toward their intended goal? 
- Now that you have most of that done, how do your wireframes reflect your objectives?






HW
---------------------------------------


1. **3x3 Idea Distillation**

	Following the [3x3 method](https://medium.com/@tomcavill/3x3-d6202ef7d077) we talked about in class, see if you can get the essence of your app down to just 3 images and 9 words. If you want, you can use the [template](https://art410f14.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/3x3.pdf) I posted to the Resources page.


2. **Create User Flows**

	Based on the objectives you've set for yourself, start to create a list of all of the major pieces of functionality your users will need in order to use your app. Then, create user flows based on Ryan Singer's ["Component Flow"](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows) method that describe how a user can move between views and accomplish their primary tasks. You should create at a detailed user flow for each major user interaction (at least three), and post them to the blog.
	

3. **Update Wireframes**

	Using the best ideas from your wireframes and those you came up with in group discussions, create a more detailed set of wireframes that express how your site will be laid out and how it will work. I would recommend using a wireframe template that matches your phone's dimensions (which you can find at google.com), and they should include enough buttons and labels that someone could figure out how to navigate and use your app without you telling them how to do it.

4. **Sign Up for InVision**

	Go to the InVision [Education](http://www.invisionapp.com/education) site and use the activation code 56-73-13-19 to sign up for an account. InVision is giving our class an expanded 'Free' account. Feel free to play around with it if you want; we'll be using this software to make some interactive prototypes next week, so be ready to get going by the start of next class.
