1. Go over Design of Everyday Things Chap. 1
2. Discuss content and mappings for Project 1
3. Fill out Objectives surveys
4. User Flows


PREP
---------------------------------------
- Load up list of UX No-No's from previous class to have ready for quiz questions
- Post Survey to blog



CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Quiz
- What are 5 things to avoid when designing a mobile UI? (Based on discussion from last class. Ask 5 different students)
	- Too many buttons (or too small, or too close together)
	- Unclear navigation
	- Too much emphasis on social media
	- Inconsistency (ie. design and function)
	- Dependency on outside apps/tools
	- Illegibility
	- Dumb Apps (Lack of clear objectives)
	- Slow or buggy
	- Disorganized/cluttered
	- Just plain ugly
	- Bad audio
	- Too much control
	- Ads everywhere


- What is the one thing you should always know before you start designing UIs? (Your objectives)
- From the reading, what is the Principle of Mapping?
- What is a Conceptual Model?






### Discuss Reading
*The Psychopathology of Everyday Things*

- How does this stuff apply to interface design?

- Affordances
	- The door
	- The projector (only one button to do two functions)
	- The phone vs. the car (one button per function in the car)
	- Show examples from [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=product%20design) (product design and UI design)
	
- Provide a Good Conceptual Model
	- The refrigerator
		
- Make Things Visible
	- Feedback
	- Make affordances clear

- Mapping 
	- Car Stereo System (balance and fade controls)
		- How could we map the speaker system in the car to be more usuable?
	
- Feedback
	- Sidetone in a phone to help regulate how loud you are talking

- Other deas to discuss
	- Wood implies opacity, sturdiness, carving. Glass implies visibility and space, and breaking
	- "Whenever the number of possible actions exceeds the number of controls, there is apt to be difficulty."
	- The usability of the floppy disk





### Discuss HW
- What sort of content did everybody collect?
- Did anybody find a competing app that was intended for just about everyone?
- What about apps that were intended for very specific groups of users?
- Lots of features? Very few features? How did this affect them?
- Who is your target audience?




### Group Discussions on Project 1 Ideas

10 minutes per student, 2 to explain, 8 to disucss.

### BREAK ###



### 3x3 Idea Distillation
Based on [Write better walkthroughs with the 3x3 Method](https://medium.com/@tomcavill/3x3-d6202ef7d077)

- Have students explain to a n00b what the product is and why they should use it. 3 illustrations, each with 3 words accompanying them. In these three columns, explain what, why and how.

What — what does your product do?
Why — what’s the benefit? (makes for a good slogan).
How — a differentiator. Perhaps an innovative piece of functionality or a cost indicator.


### User Flows

- Go over [a shorthand for designing UI flows](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)

- Have students read [Keeping the goal in sight while designing component flows](http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows)

- Discuss:
	- What was Ryan Singer trying to do on the website (ie. What was his objective?)? (to watch a video online)
	- What was the website he was using try to get him to do (ie. What was the site's implied objective)? (to have users log in or create accounts)
	- How did Ryan propose solving it? (Instead of having user reset password, just send a verification email to the user, then let them proceed from there straight to the video)
	- What did he see as the core reason that the site didn't do this to begin with? (Basic requirements are set out, and then split for separate people to tackle. UX and user flow were separated)


- Take what you learned and now lets make some user flows (20 minutes)






#### Wrap Up
- What are some of your objectives?
- Look at each step of your user flow now. Does each lead the user toward their intended goal? 
- Now that you have most of that done, how do your wireframes reflect your objectives?

1. **Create User Flows**

	Based on the objectives you've set for yourself, start to create a list of all of the major pieces of functionality your users will need in order to use your app. Then, create user flows based on Ryan Singer's ["Component Flow"](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows) method that describe how a user can move between views and accomplish their primary tasks. You should create at a detailed user flow for each major user interaction (at least three), and post them to the blog.
	

2. **Update and Expand Wireframes**

	Use the best ideas from your wireframes and those you came up with in group discussions and create a more detailed set of wireframes that express how your site will be laid out and how it will work. They don't need to be in any particularly format, and they don't need to be overly detailed, but they should include buttons and labels enough that someone could figure out how to navigate and use your app.
 

3. **Bring Android or iPhone/iPod Touch to Class**

	Make sure to install [POP](https://popapp.in/) before you come! If you don't have a smart phone, well... you're missing out!.
