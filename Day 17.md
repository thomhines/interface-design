PREP
---------------------------------------
- Post Questionnaire to blog


CLASS
---------------------------------------




### Quiz
Based on [A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/) 

- What is *A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design* about?

- What are the two main things that a tool must do? (address a need, meet our capabilities)
	> a tool converts what we *can* do into what we *want* to do
	
	- And what are the two parts that a tool has? (The part that fits the need, the part that fits the person)
	
- What are hands good for? (Feeling things and manipulating things)
	
- What are one of the three main uses of Experience Prototyping? 
	- Understanding existing user experiences and context
	- Exploring and evaluating design ideas	- Communicating ideas to an audience

- What are some of the considerations for making an Experience Prototype? 
	- (context, location, time, time constraints, typical user, number of users, relationships between users, etc.)
- What is one of the prototypes discussed in the *Experience Prototyping* article?

### Discuss Reading


#### [A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)

- What was the author trying to illustrate with the jar of peanut butter (that we naturally switch between a power grip and a precision grip, and that it is an intuitive interface)?

- Why does the author think that hands are so central to design?



- Are there any things wrong with his assesment?
	- What are the ways we interact with the world now? 
	- Are there many ways in which we interact without our hands? (pointing, talking, nudging, sitting, laying, stomping, gesturing, looking, reading)


- Examples
	- [Palette](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cchu/palette-a-freeform-interface-that-controls-any-sof)
	- [Pencil](http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil)


**Take 15 minutes to answer these questions**

- Describe what your interface does in 2 sentences or less.
- Who would use your interface?
- What would they hope to gain?
- What is the context/environment in which people will use your interface? Would it be used in public/private? Alone or in groups? 
- What sorts of physical items might a user have to interact with?
- What questions do you need answered about your interface to see if it is necessary or effective?





### Discuss SciFi Interfaces

#### Resource Sites
- [What Sci-Fi Tells Interaction Designers About Gestural Interfaces](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/01/sci-fi-interaction-designers-gestural-interfaces/)
- [Make It So: IxD Lessons from SciFi](http://scifiinterfaces.wordpress.com/)




#### Questions

- Go around and talk about what movies were watched, what interfaces were seen.
- What worked? What interfaces do you wish we had in the real world?
- What didn't work? Any interfaces look cool at first until you actually pictured using them?
- Did anybody watch an older movie? What did they get right/wrong?

As a group:

- What are some common tasks? (communication, transportation, productivity)
- What are some common types of interfaces? (gestural, voice, facial recognition, presence recognition)
- When might it be more beneficial to use gestures? When is voice better? (Use gesture for simple, physical manipulations, and use language for abstractions.)
- How can these interfaces suffer from ambiguity (Like the Minority Report handshake scene)? What can we do to fix that?


Show off the [Make It So: IxD Lessons from SciFi](http://scifiinterfaces.wordpress.com/) site (The analysis of [5th Element](http://scifiinterfaces.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/police-light/) is particularly good) 




### Discuss other interfaces in the media

Show off Microsoft concept videos [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWxqSEMXWuw) & [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6cNdhOKwi0)

As UX designers, what do you notice? (automation, hands-free, interfaces built into everyday items)



### Discuss 9 Concepts HW

Depending on time, discuss with whole class or in groups





HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Research Similar Interfaces/Uses**
 
	Choose one of your concepts and start to do a bit of research on how people are doing similar interactions or achieving your objectives through other means. Include screenshots and descriptions about what the interfaces do or how they works, and what is similar to your idea. Go for at least 3 examples.


2. **Make Storyboards**

	Storyboard (6 frames minimum) your interfaces user flow. When creating storyboards, you are essentially being forced to choose a setting, users, use case(s), and show how/why someone would use your interface. You don't have to be explicit about these things, but make sure you consider them carefully before you start on your boards.

3. **Rough Comps/Visual Studies**

	Different projects will have different needs, so do what you need to in order to start exploring the visual/aesthetic aspects of your project. These could be rough comps, mood boards, interface concept sketches, collecting images and assets, etc. Post whatever you make to the blog by next class.
