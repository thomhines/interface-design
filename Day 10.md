### Finish Project 1 Crits

Remember to ask for Note Buddies!



### Review Project 1
- What did you think?
- What would you change about your app?
- What did you learn? How can we make interactions more intuitive?
- What would you change about the project?



### Mini Presentations

#### Calm Technology/Ubiquitous Computing

##### Discussion
- How do these two concepts relate to one another?
- How can we apply the principles of Calm Technology to a UI?
- Do we see it being used in software UIs?
	- [Mint](https://www.mint.com/)
	- [Nest](https://nest.com/)
	- [If This Then That](https://ifttt.com/)
	- [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/)
- Why might we want to use these concepts in our UI?
- How does this relate to automation? What can we, as designers, take off our users plates and handle behind the scenes?
	


#### UX Research Methods
- [When to use UX Methods, incl. 20 brief descriptions of research methods](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/)
- [UX Techniques](http://uxmastery.com/resources/techniques/)

##### Discussion
- When do we do these kinds of research?
- What sorts of research is more qualitative vs. quantitative?
- How could they affect the design process?

### Website Ethnographies (Needs Finding)

1. Each student writes down their favorite/most used sites (at least three).
2. Then each student pairs up with one other student, ask what website the other uses the most, and then they learn as much as possible about the 'typical' user of that site.

Things they find out:
- Why do they use the site?
- What do they use the site for?
- How much do they use the site?
- What are they doing when they use that site?
- Why don't they use that site's competitors?
- And most importantly: What are the biggest challenges/problems/hurdles when using the site?




### Introduce Project 2

- Show project brief
- Randomly assign locations for students to research
	- Public Transit
	- Grocery Store
	- Shopping Mall
	- Restaurant
	- Classroom
	- Movie Theatre

Lots of new information today! And now we get to put some of that into practice. Hope you guys have a great weekend!


1. **Ethnographic Research on your location/task**

	After you've picked a location to build your second project around, I want you to physically go to your location and start to collect data on how your space is used. Based on the mini presentation we got this week on UX research methods, you should try to collect both qualitative (interviews, stories) and quantitative (personal observations and notes) data. Post photos, interview transcripts, notes, diagrams, doodles, and whatever else you make to the blog.

	Here are some questions that might help:

	- Why do they use the site?
	- What do they use the site for?
	- How much do they use the site?
	- What are they *doing* (steps and actions) when they use that site?
	- Why don't they use that site's competitors?
	- And most importantly: What are the biggest challenges/problems/hurdles they face when using the site?


2. **3 Ideas with Storyboards**â€¨	

	After you've finished your on-site research, consider what actions or tasks the user performs that could be improved. Try not to jump right to a solution; look for the biggest problems first, so that you can address real needs. Once you have your problems, now try to look for solutions. I want you to create 3 concepts for how you can address your user's needs through interfaces (app, mobile, web, jumbotron, anything) and storyboard the way that interface will work into the user flow of your location. 

	These should be quick sketches (with notes if necessary), so don't spend too much time on them. Get your ideas down and move on!
