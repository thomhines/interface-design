### Quiz ([Rapid Prototyping](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/16/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/))

- What is meant by fidelity when it comes to prototypes? 	
	- Can anybody remember what the three aspects of a prototype are that we can test for? (Visual, Functional, Content)
	- What would a low fidelity visual prototype look like? High? What about for Functional and Content?
	
- What do you think are the advantages of using high or low fidelity prototypes? (user testing, showing accurate info). 

- Disadvantages? (misleading expectations, too much time spent in wrong direction)

- What are some of the Do's and Don't's from the article?

Do:
> Avoid “prototype creep” by setting expectations for the process, including ones affecting the purpose, fidelity, scope and duration. Remind everyone, including yourself, that rapid prototyping is a means to an end, not an end in itself.

Don't:
> Don’t begin prototype review sessions without clear guidelines for feedback. Be very specific about the type of feedback you are looking for. (Are the steps logically arranged? Is the navigation clear and intuitive?) If not, be prepared for, “I don’t like the blue in the header,” or “Can’t we use this font instead?” or “Can you make this bigger, bolder, in red and flashing?”

### *Goal & User Focused Design*

Discussion
	
- Generallly, what makes for a good user experience?



*The key to making an application that does what you want is knowing clearly what you want it to do.*



From *The Elements of User Experience* (p.69):
When describing how a system works you should: 

- **Be positive. **
	Instead of describing a bad thing the system shouldn’t do, describe what it will do to prevent that bad thing. For example, instead of this:
	The system will not allow the user to purchase a kite without kite string.
	This would be better:
	The system will direct the user to the kite string page if the user tries to buy a kite without string.
	
- **Be specific.** 
	Leaving as little as possible open to interpretation is the only way we can determine whether a requirement has been fulfilled.
	Compare these examples:
	1. The most popular videos will be highlighted.
	2. Videos with the most views in the last week will appear at the top of the list.

- **Avoid subjective language.** 
	This is really just another way of being specific and removing ambiguity—and therefore the possibility for misinterpretation—from the requirements.
Here's something not to say: The site will have a hip, flashy style.





### Critique sites in small groups
	
- [nytimes.com](http://nytimes.com)  vs.  [bbc.com](http://bbc.com/)
- [reddit.com](http://reddit.com)  vs.  [pinterest](http://pinterest.com)
- [craigslist](http://craigslist.com)  vs  [ebay](http://ebay.com)

#### Questions
- Overall thoughts?
- Who are their users? 
- What is each site's main objectives?
- Why would there be differences between them?
- Which site would be more usable by your grandma?

#### Grade each site (1-10):
- hierarchy
- navigation
- aesthetics
- user experience




#### Discussion
- How can we apply the principles of Calm Technology to a UI?
	- Do we see it being used in software UIs?
		- [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/)
		- [If This Then That](https://ifttt.com/)
		- [Mint](https://www.mint.com/)
		- [Nest](https://nest.com/)
	- How does this relate to automation? What can we, as designers, take off our users plates and handle behind the scenes?
- How about Game Design? How can we apply these ideas?
	- [Haze](http://gethaze.com/)
	- [CARROT to do](http://www.meetcarrot.com/)
- When not to use these things:
	- [It overwhelms your objectives](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/26/gamification-ux-users-win-lose/)
	- [You are doing it in for nafarious ends](http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4640308/dark-patterns-inside-the-interfaces-designed-to-trick-you?utm_source=buffer&utm_campaign=Buffer&utm_content=buffer2101a&utm_medium=twitter)
	



### Prototypes

Using [Prototyping on Paper (POP)](https://popapp.in/), turn your app into a prototype. If you don't have an smart phone, then get [ClickDummy](https://clickdummy.com/) or [FieldTest](http://fieldtestapp.com/) loaded up in a browser.

- Spend 20 minutes building prototypes. If you need more frames, that's OK, make them.
- Try it out with two other people in class. Don't give too much information. Take note of what they think they are supposed to do with it, and how they navigate your app. 
- Start to make a brief questionnaire for your test users (5-7 questions).










HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Finish Prototypes**

	Keep working on the POP/proto.io prototypes for next week. You should probably have enough wireframes in your prototype to test out the entirety of your user flows. For instance, don't worry about settings pages if they aren't central to how your app works. If your login screen would help people understand how the app is customized to them or if it syncs with an outside web service, then it might be worth including. It's up to you to determine what you need, but do everything you can to make the app feel like a complete experience.


2. **Create Test User Questionnaire**

	Create a list of questions (probably 4-7) that you can ask your test users to help guide their feedback. Think about what it is you most want to learn about your app ideas (Is the user flow clear? Does it make sense to put the friends list after the map page, or before?) and then create the questions that allow for your testers to concretely address them.


4. **User Flows**

	Using the flow shorthand technique we talked about in class a few weeks ago, document the various states and actions a user can take when using your app. What are the things your users are actually trying to do? Are there multiple ways to navigate? What sort of errors or problems might a user run into? How do you handle them? If you'd rather do this step before you make your prototype, that's fine. Post your work to WordPress. 


5. **Mood Boards**

	I want to see 20 pieces of inspiration/concepts/color palettes/type specimens for how you want to style your app. Post this to the blog as well.
	
6. **Read Chapter 2 of Design of Everyday Things**
	
	Which can be found [here](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/Design%20of%20Everyday%20Things%20-%20Chapter%202.pdf).
