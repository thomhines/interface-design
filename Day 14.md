1. **Keep Designing**

	Keep going with your designs! By next class you should be pretty much done with how your interface looks and feels, and have a solid idea of what your presentation will be like. We'll be practicing presenting to one another next class, so don't come underprepared!
	
	
2. **Mini Presentations**

	If you have to give a presentation next week on your topic (assigned at the beginning of the term), get it ready and make it good!


3. **Test/Prototype User Flow**

	Using a combination of role playing, sketching, talking, the "Wizard of Oz" technique, or whatever you need to walk someone through the process of using your interface. If your interface is supposed to be in a place that  you can't physically get to, fake it in your home or on the street. Do your best to create placeholders for all of the elements necessary to make this work. Document your findings (notes and photos) and post them to the blog.
