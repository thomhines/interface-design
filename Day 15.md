1. **Finish Designs**

	I want these suckas to be AMAZING. You guys have your work cut out for you. Don't worry about making tons of screens, but DO make your details shine.


2. **Make Amazing Presentations**

	Remember what we talked about several weeks ago about presenting UI: Try to make your apps connect emotionally with your users (which probably means you shouldn't be listing features or talking tech specs at any point in your presentation), define who you are making your app for if it isn't already clear, and help us all understand *why* somebody would ever want your app. You guys did a great job last time; keep up the same level of polish and attention to detail. And don't forget to PRACTICE!
	
	


3. **Test/Prototype User Flow**

	Using a combination of role playing, sketching, talking, the "Wizard of Oz" technique, or whatever you need to walk someone through the process of using your interface. If your interface is supposed to be in a place that you can't physically get to, fake it in your home or on the street. Do your best to create placeholders for all of the elements necessary to make this work. Document your findings (notes and photos) and post them to the blog. 




3. **Watch a SciFi Movie (Due Monday)**

	Pick a Science Fiction movie that deals with technology or clearly incorporates UI into the story's universe and take note of all of the forms of interface you see throughout the film. Keep in mind that some interfaces are passive/invisible (eg. the automatic doors in Star Trek, or Jarvis the virtual assistant in Iron Man). Then select one of these interfaces and analyze it from a design perspective. What are it's strengths and weaknesses? Does it make sense for the particular context it's being used in? Would it be practical in a real world setting?

4. **9 Experimental Interface Concepts (Due Monday)**

	Take at least three of the technologies/concepts that we discussed in class and think about how you could apply them to a user's needs or problems. Don't limit yourself to what you know is technologically possible, and money is no object. Create a simple diagram of each, and post them along with a description to the blog. Feel free to go into detail, but your focus should definitely be on getting down as many ideas as possible.
