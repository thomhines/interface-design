	Create 2 alternative paths to achieve your objectives. They don't have to be better for everybody, but each should be focused on a particular objective or stakeholder. Look at what is trying to be done, and find as many ways as you can to help make that happen in a faster, safer, funner, cooler, or smarter way. Document this with sketches and notes, and post it to the blog.
