---------------------------------------

Great improvements, everyone! I'm really excited about the work getting done. Ridiculously awesome designs and ideas.

For those of you who weren't in class, we made the group decision that we'll be putting off final crits on Project 1 until next Wednesday. We'll start Project 2 on Monday and practice presenting your Project 1s. Here are the [notes on Presenting UI](http://art410w14.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/notes-on-presenting-ui/) that I went over in class today.


1. Read [How to do a Product Critique](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-do-a-product-critique-98b657050638)
1. **Finish Up Designs**

	All I want you to do is make them perfect. Aesthetics, Usability, everything. Everything perfect.


2. **Make a Presentation**

	Don't come to class with just your slides and expect to be able to get full points on this thing. Presenting interactivity isn't as simple as it looks. Practice what you're going to say to at least one person who doesn't know anything about your app, and make sure all of your slides look perfect.
	
	Remember: 1) Make your presentation have some emotional impact, and 2) Show your app through the lens of a (fake) real person trying to use it. The best way to convince your audience is by making it seem like something that a real human can operate.
	
	If you are presenting a series of images for your slides, first convert them into a single PDF so that you can have all of them in one document. Presentations should be no longer than 8 minutes, but ideally they can be shown and explained in 5-6. Less is more.
