### Discuss UI Inspiration and Kits

#### Nice UIs
- [iPhone App Concepts](http://line25.com/articles/showcase-of-beautiful-iphone-app-ui-concept-designs)

#### Kits
- [30 Free UI Kits](http://line25.com/articles/30-free-ui-kits-featuring-detailed-web-elements)
- [10 Flat UI Kits](http://webdesignledger.com/freebies/10-super-useful-free-flat-ui-kits)


### Presenting UI

#### Show examples
- Nathan (Hammayburger)  - User Case Studies (Personas)
- Asley (See Spot Park) - Narrative, needs-based presentation
- Nicole (Intellifeed) - Animation and user flow
- Phillip (iGot2Go) - Humor, character, needs-based



#### Tips on Presenting IxD
**from Hirumi Nanayakkara**

1.	*Empathy*. Your audience needs to emotionally connect to what you are pitching for you to sell it well. In order to that, you need to tell a really good story. What is the problem that your product is solving? Every great website/digital product tells a compelling story by interweaving thoughtful UI with meaningful interactions and gestures.  

2.	*Identify the target demographic*-- interview users, create personas, and go through user flows. I find that many people like to skip over this part, but its so so important

3.	*Analysis*-- competitive and comparative. You should know what is already out there and why your product is better than it, and also things that inspire you

4.	*Prioritize features*-- list out everything you and your users want your product to do and then prioritize. Designing for mobile first makes this easy, and also helps in cutting out bells + whistles that dont actually make your product better

<!--
5.	*Wireframe + Prototype*-- simple paper prototyping or interactive PDFs can help you figure out what you need to build before wasting a lot of time coding/designing

#### Presentation Skeleton

I wouldn't say this is always the best way to frame a presentation, but this is what made the most sense for us to "sell the sizzle."

1. break down the concept so that its super easy to understand + remember

2. walk through a user scenario--make the audience connect with the app and concept and why its something they could see themselves or someone they know using

3. show that there is a need for this. for this particular concept, we were driven by the horrid gender biases of apps designed for women, and the few apps that we found to be inspiring

4. we then used real world data that validated our thinking

5. then it was time to show that there is a real world interest in the world of gardening--this touched on bigger concepts in digital gaming including the success of social responsibility in games like farmville, and also eco-feminism

6. then we talked about all the parameters we needed to meet for the class

7. then walked through the app interface (ed. Note how late this comes in these steps!)

8. and validated our concept through showing interviews with people that would potentially endorse our idea if we won (eyebeam and the UN)






### Group Crits

Split class into 2 groups. Meet 1-on-1 with students who want feedback


### Work Session


HW
---------------------------------------

Great improvements, everyone! I'm really excited about the work getting done. Ridiculously awesome designs and ideas.

For those of you who weren't in class, we made the group decision that we'll be putting off final crits on Project 1 until next Wednesday. We'll start Project 2 on Monday and practice presenting your Project 1s. Here are the notes on Presenting UI that I went over in class today.


1. **Finish Up Designs**

	All I want you to do is make them perfect. Aesthetics, Usability, everything. Everything perfect.


2. **Make a Presentation**

	Don't come to class with just your slides and expect to be able to get full points on this thing. Presenting interactivity isn't as simple as it looks. Practice what you're going to say to at least one person who doesn't know anything about your app, and make sure all of your slides look perfect.
	
	Remember: 1) Make your presentation have some emotional impact, and 2) Show your app through the lens of a (fake) real person trying to use it. The best way to convince your audience is by making it seem like something that a real human can operate.
	
	If you are presenting a series of images for your slides, first convert them into a single PDF so that you can have all of them in one document. Presentations should be no longer than 10 minutes, but ideally they can be shown and explained in 5-6. Less is more.
