### Small Group discussions on project ideas

While they work in small groups, talk with students one-on-one

ORâ€¦

Break up class into small groups. Let other groups work on their stuff while I talk to each group of 3-4 students in turn. That way each group gets longer feedback and students get more time to work.


### Work Session



HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Keep Designing**

	While we do have the weekend to put finishing touches on our projects, next class will be the last opportunity to run your ideas by your peers. Make use of the time we have left and, using the feedback you got today, try to make significant progress on your comps. Post your progress to the blog.


2. **Make Amazing Presentations**

	We will be doing informal practice presentations in small groups, so you may want to start thinking about the order in which you would showcase your comps and how you can clearly and concisely talk about your app to others.

3. **Mini Presentations**

	For those of you who haven't given a presentation yet, next class is probably when your presentation is due! We'll spend the beginning of next class talking about alternative UIs, so make sure you have an awesome presentation ready for us!
