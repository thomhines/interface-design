CLASS
---------------------------------------

### Discuss Bad UX
- Review HW

Make list on board of all the things that can make for frustrating UX:

(Get one student to write on board, and one to copy list and post to blog)

1. False Expectations
2. Bad hierarchy
3. Faulty accessibility content
4. Harsh color schemes
5. Unclear navigation
6. Slow load time
7. Lack of directions/purpose
8. Reinventing the wheel is risky
9. Breaking typical navigation patterns
10. Unsolicited audio
11. Giving user too much control
12. Ads
13. Too much clutter
14. Body Copy = Bad experience
15. Illegibility (http://www.rumim.org/, from Yumi's bad web site)
16. Bad Search Functionality (from our very own http://www.pdx.edu/, thanks Kristen)
17. Poor Page Structure (from just about all the sites. Particularly when a site doesn't fit inside a laptop-sized browser window)
18. Offputting Aesthetics
19. Difficult to Control Elements (too small buttons, sliders that break, etc.)
20. Over-reliance on meme humor (j/k)

***AND WHATEVER YOU DO, MAKE SURE YOU ARE DESIGNING WITH YOUR OBJECTIVES IN MIND!***

### Considerations for Mobile Design 

***Use Keynote Presentation***



- Context
	- Short term
	- Distracted
	- Outside/Away
	- Different Kinds of Data
		- Forms - [Examples](http://html5doctor.com/html5-forms-input-types/)
	
- Touch Screens
	- Gestures - [Examples](http://www.mobiletuxedo.com/touch-gesture-icons/)
	- Size - [Device Dimensions](http://stefhatcher.com/projects/device-dimensions/)
	- [Easy to reach sections](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php)
	- Button Sizes - [Smashing Magazine](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/21/finger-friendly-design-ideal-mobile-touchscreen-target-sizes/)
	
- [Limitations](http://baymard.com/blog/mobile-design-limitations)
	- No Hover State
	- Slow and Error prone typing
	- Less Context (Can't always see what you are doing compared to rest of the screen, esp. when keyboard is up)
	- Inaccurate Clicks
	- Poor Connectivity
	- Slow Hardware
	- Distractability (Other events and notifications can overtake the precedence of your app)

- Extra Features
	- GPS
	- Accelerometer
	- Compass
	- Bluetooth
	- Wifi
	- Camera
	- Proximity Sensor
	- Flashlight
	- Microphone
	- Speakers



### Start on HW



HW

**Me: Post link to mini presentations spreadsheet on the Resources page**

1. **Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1**

	This book is a classic, and an incredibly smart and easy-to-read look at how design affects usability. We will be reading several select chapters from this book, so make sure to buy this book soon. For now, here's [Chapter 1](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/Design%20of%20Everyday%20Things%20-%20Chapter%201.pdf).
	

2. **Market Position and Feature Survey** 	
	Answer these questions and post them to the blog:

	1. What problem is your app trying to solve? (What are the top three objectives for your app?)
	2. When do people typically use an app like this?
	3. Who is your audience?
	4. What are *all* of the features that apps like yours have?
	5. What sets your app apart from the rest?


3. **3 Sets of Wireframes** 	
	I want to see three distinct directions. You don't have to design the login screens or anything else that you'll see in most other apps, but I do want to see the layout and core interactions for the main aspects of your app.

	Consider different layouts, different interactions, and different affordances in each direction. What if you change your audience? What if you alter your main objective? Create a minimum of 5 frames per direction (15 frames total).
