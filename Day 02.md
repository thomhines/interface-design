ART 410 - Day 2
=======================================

1. Discuss Principles of User Interface Design
2. Discuss what makes for a poor UI
3. Considerations for Mobile Design


PREP
---------------------------------------
- Post Design of Everyday Things, Chap. 1 to server
- Get URLs loaded in browser (nytimes.com, bbc.com, reddit, pinterest, craigslist, ebay, family tree sites, past student examples)
- Load up examples of previous student's Project 1 (Michelle, Kristen, )
- Load up examples of flow charts, maps, timelines, choose your own adventure, infographics



CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Quiz 

- What are some of the sub-fields of Interaction Design that we talked about last class? (UX, UI, Information Architect)

Based on [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/) 
- According to the article we read, what is the first and most important job of any interface? (Clarity)
	- Why is clarity so important? (It makes the difference between an app that's usable and one that isn't.)

- Go through list of principles and find examples from the apps that people posted





### Housekeeping
- Have people change their WP name to their full name (if necessary)
- Questions?






### Discuss Good/Bad UX
- Review HW

Make list on board of all the things that can make for frustrating or positive UX:

(Get one student to write on board, and one to copy list and post to blog)

Bad:
1. False Expectations
2. Bad hierarchy
3. Faulty accessibility content
4. Harsh color schemes
5. Unclear navigation
6. Slow load time
7. Lack of directions/purpose
8. Reinventing the wheel is risky
9. Breaking typical navigation patterns
10. Unsolicited audio
11. Giving user too much control
12. Ads
13. Too much clutter
14. Body Copy = Bad experience
15. Illegibility (http://www.rumim.org/, from Yumi's bad web site)
16. Bad Search Functionality (from our very own http://www.pdx.edu/, thanks Kristen)
17. Poor Page Structure (from just about all the sites. Particularly when a site doesn't fit inside a laptop-sized browser window)
18. Offputting Aesthetics
19. Difficult to Control Elements (too small buttons, sliders that break, etc.)
20. Over-reliance on meme humor (j/k)

***AND WHATEVER YOU DO, MAKE SURE YOU ARE DESIGNING WITH YOUR OBJECTIVES IN MIND!***

### Considerations for Mobile Design 

***Use Keynote Presentation***



- Context
	- Short term
	- Distracted
	- Outside/Away
	- Different Kinds of Data
		- Forms - [Examples](http://html5doctor.com/html5-forms-input-types/)
	
- Touch Screens
	- Gestures - [Examples](http://www.mobiletuxedo.com/touch-gesture-icons/)
	- Size - [Device Dimensions](http://stefhatcher.com/projects/device-dimensions/)
	- [Easy to reach sections](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php)
	- Button Sizes - [Smashing Magazine](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/21/finger-friendly-design-ideal-mobile-touchscreen-target-sizes/)
	
- [Limitations](http://baymard.com/blog/mobile-design-limitations)
	- No Hover State
	- Slow and Error prone typing
	- Less Context (Can't always see what you are doing compared to rest of the screen, esp. when keyboard is up)
	- Inaccurate Clicks
	- Poor Connectivity
	- Slow Hardware
	- Distractability (Other events and notifications can overtake the precedence of your app)

- Extra Features
	- GPS
	- Accelerometer
	- Compass
	- Bluetooth
	- Wifi
	- Camera
	- Proximity Sensor
	- Flashlight
	- Microphone
	- Speakers



### Start on HW



HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1**

	This book is a classic, and an incredibly smart and easy-to-read look at how design affects usability. This weekend I want you to read [Chapter 1](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/Design%20of%20Everyday%20Things%20-%20Chapter%201.pdf).

OR MAYBE **[this article on affordances](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/24/affordance-most-underrated-word-in-web-design/)**
	

2. **Market Position and Feature Survey** 	
	Answer these questions and post them to the blog:

	1. What are *all* of the features that apps like yours have?
	2. When do people typically use an app like this? Who are these people?
	3. What problem is *your* app trying to solve? (What are the top three objectives for the app you want to make? What sets your app apart from the rest?)


3. **3 Sets of Wireframes** 	
	I want to see three distinct directions. You don't have to design the login screens or anything else that you'll see in most other apps, but I do want to see the layout and core interactions for the main aspects of your app.

	Consider different layouts, different interactions, and different affordances in each direction. What if you change your audience? What if you alter your main objective? Create a minimum of 5 frames per direction (15 frames total).



4. **Mood Boards/Design Research**

	Your first round of designs will be due next Thursday (two days after our next class), so make sure that you get a head start on it! Do as much as you can, but I'd like to see at least 20 pieces of design inspiration, type studies, color samples and whatever else you need to get started on actually designing something next week.
