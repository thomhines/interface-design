PREP
---------------------------------------



CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Quiz

- What are the two main phases of the double diamond design process? (finding the right problem, finding the right solution)
	- And what are the two phases of each of those phases? (Divergence and convergence)


- How many people does Norman and Jakob Neilson recommend testing your designs with? (5, but make sure to do this often: 5 more with each iteration)
	- Why?


- What is the difference between activity-centered and human-centered design? 
	- What are the advantages of activity centered design? (people change from place to place and culture to culture, but certain tasks and activities tend to stay the same despite that. Designs can have much broader appeal. Norman uses driving as an example. )
	


### Discuss Design of Everyday Things, Chap. 6




- Does any of this reading sound familiar to the process we've started already?
	- Solving the correct problem
	- Double Diamond Design process
	- Human Centered design

		- Apples iPod example
			- Why was it successful? (Because Apple focused on "listening to music", not features or devices)


- Iterative Design vs. linear stages
	- Waterfall (or gated waterfall) design process
		- What is it?
	- Iterative design
		- What is it? (mention Agile or scrum)
	
	- What are the advantages of each? (more control for management, each step is preceded by thorough review and research, clear path)
	- Disadvantages? (cumbersome, slow, always behind, can't adapt)


- Products have multiple, conflicting requirements
	- Who are we designing for? What needs are being addressed? Even if we just choose the end user, we have to be aware of that and of the other stakeholders.
	
- What did you guys learn from the example of the OXO peeler?
	- Designing for edge cases (special people), can actually make products that are more usable by anybody
		
	> The best solution to the problem of designing for everyone is flexibility: flexibility in the size of the images on computer screens, in the sizes, heights, and angles of tables and chairs.



- Complexity Is Good; It Is Confusion That Is Bad
	> Complex things are no longer complicated once they are understood.



*From previous edition:*

- What are some of the ways that designers go astray, according to Norman? (Putting aesthetics first, designers are not typical users, designers design for clients who isn't the user)













### Critique sites in small groups
	
- [nytimes.com](http://nytimes.com)  vs.  [bbc.com](http://bbc.com/)
- [reddit.com](http://reddit.com)  vs.  [pinterest](http://pinterest.com)
- [craigslist](http://craigslist.com)  vs  [ebay](http://ebay.com)

#### Questions
- Overall thoughts?
- Who are their users? 
- What is each site's main objectives?
- Why would there be differences between them?
- Which site would be more usable by your grandma?

#### Grade each site (1-10):
- hierarchy
- navigation
- aesthetics
- user experience







### Discuss Pain Points




HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Define Your Problem**

	Now that you've figured out all the ways in which your objective can be made difficult by some of its sub-tasks, now is the time to hone in on which aspects you would like to focus your attention. Just like the double diamond that was mentioned in the reading, we'll converge on a more limited set of problems and focus our attention to solving those. Pick the top 3 pain points you want to devote yourself to, and list them in order of how you want to prioritize them.


2. **Define Your Stakeholders**

	You may be designing for the end user of your product or process, but consider all of the people who are involved in making your objective happen? Store owners? Landords? Manufacturers? Make a list of all of the people involved, and then choose one group/user type that you want to focus on. Now, write a couple paragraphs defining this primary audience. Who are they? What do they do? When and why are they doing your objective task? Give as much detail as you can to help clarify who you are designing for. Post all of this, including your list of stakeholders, to the blog.
	
3. **BONUS POINTS: Interviews**

	If you really want to get into this (and you want a few points of extra credit), observe and interview a person or three doing your objective task. Write up your findings and post them and any photos/documentation to the blog.


4. **10 Solutions**

	Only after you have done the preceding steps, start to brainstorm solutions to the pain points you isolated in step 1. These solutions can address more than just one pain point (and that's great!), but make sure you maintain your focus on the objectives you've set for yourself. You can do more than 10 ideas if you want; feel free to put down weird and unrealistic ideas. This isn't the point at which you should edit yourself. Post your sketches and notes to the blog, but please make sure they are legible and understandable. Go quick, but in a way that helps others get what you're talking about.
