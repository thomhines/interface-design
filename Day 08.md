1. **Choose an app you want to make**
	
	Look over the list of apps from the Project 2 brief—as well as the apps you have on your computer and on your phone—and pick an app that you'd like to make/remake. Ideally, this would be something that you yourself would use and could integrate well into your daily life.


2. **Research similar apps**
	
	Find what your competition is doing; at least 5 similar apps. Make notes (visual and written) on how they accomplish certain features, and start laying out the pros and cons of each. Document what features they have in common, what sets them apart, who their typical user might be, etc. You should be a mini-expert in what is available and how various products act in this field. Post your research to the blog (NOTE: This will almost certainly involve some writing)
