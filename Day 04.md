ART 410 - Day 4
=======================================

1. Student presentations of wireframes
2. Prototypes


PREP
---------------------------------------
- Load up links
- Print out tons of [templates](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0042/9602/files/iphoneSketchpad_a4_v9-BW.pdf)
 for students to fill out in class




CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Quiz
- What does a user flow look like (according to Ryan Singer)?
- What information is included on one step of a user flow?
- What issue did Ryan try to solve in his example with the video?
- How did he suggest solving it?



### Student Presentations of User Flows
- Break into 3 groups
- Brief overview of all 3 (10 minutes per student)
	- What is the intended objective?
	- Do the steps lead toward that objective?
	- Are the steps clear?
	- Is anything missing?
	- How could a user break this process?
	- How can the user flow be improved?



### Wireframes


#### Tools
- [wireframe.cc](http://wireframe.cc)
- [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/)
- [UI Parade](http://webzap.uiparade.com/)
- [Keynotopia](http://keynotopia.com/)
- [Keynote Kung-Fu](http://keynotekungfu.com/)
- [Pen and Paper](http://speckyboy.com/2011/05/29/20-effective-examples-of-web-and-mobile-wireframe-sketches/)

For today, we'll be doing pen and paper. Using the feedback you got from your group, build wireframes for each of your views. 


	
### Break

### Prototype Mini Presentation

- What is the point of prototyping? What can we expect to get out of it?


### Prototypes

#### Protyping Process
From [Design Better, Faster with Rapid Prototyping](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/16/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/)

- Prototype
- Review
- Refine 

Questions to ask yourself before prototyping:	
- What are we prototyping?
- What kind of fidelity is needed at this point?
	- Visual (sketched ↔ styled)
	- Functional (static ↔ interactive)
	- Content (lorem ipsum ↔ real content)

Do:
> Avoid “prototype creep” by setting expectations for the process, including ones affecting the purpose, fidelity, scope and duration. Remind everyone, including yourself, that rapid prototyping is a means to an end, not an end in itself.

Don't:
> Don’t be a perfectionist. In most cases, rapid prototyping does not have to be 100% perfect, just good enough to give everyone a common understanding.



#### Create Prototypes

Using [Prototyping on Paper (POP)](https://popapp.in/) or InVision, turn your wireframe into a prototype.

To sign up with InVision students just sign up with their .edu accounts at http://www.invisionapp.com/education

Validation Code: **56-73-13-19**

- Spend 20 minutes building prototypes. If you need more frames, that's OK, make them.
- Try it out with two other people in class. Don't give too much information. Take note of what they think they are supposed to do with it, and how they navigate your app. 
- Start to make a brief questionnaire for your test users (5-7 questions).



- Examples

HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Finish Survey**

	For those of you who weren't in class, the survey is posted on the home page of the blog. You don't need to print it out. Instead, copy the questions to a new post in WordPress and answer them there. For the first question, make sure to list at least three overarching objectives you have for the blog. Make sure to publish the post when you are done.
	
	
3. **User Testing**

	First, finish your prototype.

	Second, create a list of questions (probably 4-7) that you can ask your test users to help guide their feedback. Think about what it is you most want to learn about your app ideas (Is the user flow clear? Does it make sense to put the friends list after the map page, or before?) and then create the questions that allow for your testers to concretely address them. Remember: these tests are for *you*, not for your testers. 

	Test your prototype with at least 3 people who haven't or heard of your app before. You don't need to take screen shots of them using your app, but do take notes on what they do and say about your app. Are they getting stuck in some particular part of your app? Do they get confused about what a particular feature does? Write down these details, along with their answers to your questionnaire, and post them to the blog. If you need more templates, you can get some here: [Templates](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0042/9602/files/iphoneSketchpad_a4_v9-BW.pdf).


4. **Mood Boards/Design Research**

	Your first round of designs will be due next Thursday (two days after our next class), so make sure that you get a head start on it! Do as much as you can, but I'd like to see at least 20 pieces of design inspiration, type studies, color samples and whatever else you need to get started on actually designing something next week.
