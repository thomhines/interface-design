- Shaun Inman: Charlie
	- Designer as author
		- Shaun has created a number of apps like Mint and Fever that address a specific need through design, much like you guys are doing.
		- He describes Fever as 'opinionated software', by which he means that it's meant to be a panacea. It's his take on how an RSS feed reader should be, and it has a lot of limitations. Even so, it is wildly popular.
	- Game Design as User Design
	





HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Watch a SciFi Movie**

	Pick a Science Fiction movie that deals with technology or clearly incorporates UI into the story's universe and take note of all of the forms of interface you see throughout the film. Keep in mind that some interfaces are passive/invisible (eg. the automatic doors in Star Trek, or Jarvis the virtual assistant in Iron Man). Then select one of these interfaces and analyze it from a design perspective. What are it's strengths and weaknesses? Does it make sense for the particular context it's being used in? Would it be practical in a real world setting? And most importantly: *What problem is it solving?*
