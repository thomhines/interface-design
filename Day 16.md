1. **Read [A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)**


2. **Project 2 Self-Evaluation**

	Especially since this is the first time I tried to do this project, I'm extra interested in hearing what you thought of it and of how you yourself did throughout the process. How do you feel your final product turned out? What would you have done differently? How might the project itself be changed? Your feedback will definitely be taken into account when making this class next year, so please be honest!


3. **Watch a SciFi Movie**

	Pick a Science Fiction movie that deals with technology or clearly incorporates UI into the story's universe and take note of all of the forms of interface you see throughout the film. Keep in mind that some interfaces are passive/invisible (eg. the automatic doors in Star Trek, or Jarvis the virtual assistant in Iron Man). Then select one of these interfaces and analyze it from a design perspective. What are it's strengths and weaknesses? Does it make sense for the particular context it's being used in? Would it be practical in a real world setting?

4. **9 Experimental Interface Concepts**

	Take at least three of the technologies/concepts that we discussed in class and think about how you could apply them to a user's needs or problems. Don't limit yourself to what you know is technologically possible, and money is no object. Create a simple diagram of each, and post them along with a description to the blog. Feel free to go into detail, but your focus should definitely be on getting down as many ideas as possible.
