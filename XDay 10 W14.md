2. **Document Traditional User Flows**

	Take note of all of the steps and key decisions necessary to accomplish your assigned task. Be as thorough and as detailed as possible. At the very least, you should have 10 steps/decision points. 

	
3. **Research Tools**

	After you've documented the steps 


4. **Find Pain Points**

	Find (at least) 3 points in the process that are the most difficult, time consuming or annoying for doing your task...


<!--
2. **Alternative Processes**

	Create 2 alternative user flows to achieve your objectives. They don't have to be better for everybody, but each should be focused on a particular objective or stakeholder. Look at what is trying to be done, and find as many ways as you can to help make that happen in a faster, safer, funner, cooler, or smarter way. Document this with sketches and notes, and post it to the blog.
