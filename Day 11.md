### QUIZ

- What was Chapter 2 of *Design of Everyday Things* about? (Psychology of Everyday Actions, what users attribute errors to, 7 stages of action)
- What is an "opportunistic action"?
- In a general sense, what are the 7 stages of action? Can you remember any of them specifically?
 	- Forming the goal
	- Forming the intention
	- Specifying an action
	- Executing the action
	- Perceiving the state of the world
	- Interpreting the state of the world
	- Evaluating the outcome
	

### Go over Reading

- What are some of ways in which your apps competitors lend themselves to being misused by users? (ie, what is the most frustrating parts of the apps you're using?)

	- Feedly marks as read even if you scroll just a pixel to far, or if you scroll up and then down
	- Gmail takes away the ability to undo send, even if you just click the 'view message' link


- How can we avoid making designs that alienate our users?



- How can you incorporate "opportunisitic actions" (actions that happen in the normal course of someone's day). Similar to Calm Technology.
	- Reminders that come up when you arrive at work or home instead of just at some specific time.
	- Alarm clocks that remind you to turn them on if you usually wake up at the same time everyday.


- How do the 7 steps of actions relate to IxD?


	- *Visibility*. By looking, the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action.
	- *A good conceptual model*. The designer provides a good conceptual model for the user, with consistency in the presentation of operations and results and a coherent, consistent system image.
	- *Good mappings*. It is possible to determine the relationships between actions and results, between the controls and their effects, and between the system state and what is visible.
	- *Feedback*. The user receives full and continuous feedback about the results of actions.	



	
> "If an error is possible, someone will make it. The designer must assume that all possible errors will occur and design so as to minimize the chance of the error in the first place, or its effects once it gets made. Errors should be easy to detect, they should have minimal consequences, and, if possible, their effects should be reversible." - p. 36

- Prevention, Correction, Recovery (Elements of User Experience, pg. 87)



### Mini Presentation - Shaun Inman
- Designer as author
	- Shaun has created a number of apps like Mint and Fever that address a specific need through design, much like you guys are doing.
	- He describes Fever as 'opinionated software', by which he means that it's meant to be a panacea. It's his take on how an RSS feed reader should be, and it has a lot of limitations. Even so, it is wildly popular.
	
- Game Design as User Design



### Discuss Prototypes
- How did they go?
- Did anybody get any good reactions?
- Did any of you have to update your wireframes or user flows to account for problems your testers ran into?
- What did you think of POP? What did your testers think?



HW
---------------------------------------


1. **First Drafts of Design Comps**
	
	See how far you can take your design over the next couple days. I want to see 3 directions (1 comp per direction) exploring color, type, composition, etc. These are meant to be rough, medium fidelity drafts, so don't spend time on kerning and tweaking pixels. You can work from any or all of your wireframes, but whatever you do, try to be as experimental and divergent as possible.Â We'll fine tune things over the weekend.
