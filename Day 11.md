HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Read UI Design Best Practices, Chap. 3**

	You can find the PDF [here](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/UI%20Design%20Best%20Practices,%20Chap.%203.pdf). This reading will guide you on the process of creating Personas and User Scenarios, which will help you on the next part of the homework...


2. **Create 3 Personas** 

	Create three "characters" who are typical users of your UI. These people shouldn't be clones of one another, and it's often a good idea to build some challenges into your personas. Who are they? What do they want? What are they willing (or unwilling) to do? Be realistic. These "imaginary best friends" can help you see where your problems lie and they will be the guides throughout the design process to help you know whether your interface is doing what it needs to do.


3. **Design Research**

	After you've settled on an idea, start to collect research on the character, tone, and form of your UI. I want to see at least 20 pieces of inspiration. These can be fonts, colors, compositions, screen shots, design patterns, or whatever you need to have something to work from and to work towards.


4. **User Flows**

	Create user flows for how people might navigate your space with the introduction of your UI. You might not have to list out screens like we did last time, but instead it might be focused on each step in their process coupled with each option a user has. If these steps are different for each of your personas, you should consider making a user flow for each. Also, consider what your users are doing before, during and after they interact in your space; your UI might have to adapt to each context.
