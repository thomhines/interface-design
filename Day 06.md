### Skeumorphism vs. Flat Design
[Flat Pixels](http://sachagreif.com/flat-pixels/)



#### Skeumorphism


[Examples](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/inspiration/50-skeuomorphic-designs)

> This obscure word describes the way designs often borrow a particular feature from the past, even when the functional need for it is gone. Examples include pre-recorded shutter noises on smartphones to remind us of film cameras, or calendar apps that feature torn paper and metal rings.

Or, as Wikipedia tells us [1]:

> A skeuomorph is a physical ornament or design on an object copied from a form of the object when made from another material or by other techniques.

	
- What are some of the main characteristics of Skeumorphic Design?
	- Realism in details
	- Layouts mimic physical products
- What kind of advantages might it bring?
	- A tactile quality
	- More immersive
	
- Problems? 
	- Can be kitschy if not done well
	- Faulty affordances (looks like a knob, but doesn't act like one)
	- Old format may not be well suited to screens
	- Limited by what previous versions have done









#### Flat Design
- Examples: 
	- [Make My Design Flat](http://makemydesignflat.com/)
	- [Clear](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/)
	- [Letterpress](http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/)
	- [Flat UI](http://bashooka.com/inspiration/flat-web-ui-design/)

- What are some of the main characteristics of Flat Design?
	- Huge typography
	- high contrast
	- large buttons
	- simple icons
	- geometric design

- What kind of advantages might it bring?
	- Readability
	- Clarity
	- Accessibility

- Problems?
	- Lack of affordances (no bevels or shadows to set buttons apart)
	- Despite contrasty colors, lack of hierarchy





### Presenting UI
- Examples
	- [PSD Mockups](http://line25.com/articles/20-free-psds-to-mockup-your-app-interface-designs)
	- Student Work:
		- Michelle's Walking Dead
		- Regeena's Family Tree Discovery
		- Yumi's Family Directory

- Discussing features
	- Clear and *CONCISE*
	- Leave out the obvious or the boring
	- Discuss features only when the feature itself is of special interest; otherwise, make it about how the app/object fits in the users life
	- Indicating interactions (icons)
	- Indicating transitions 
		- Series of images
			- [UX Archive](http://uxarchive.com/)
		- Animations
			- [hoverstat.es](http://hoverstat.es/)
			- [Six UX](http://sixux.com/)
			- [UI Animations](http://ui-animations.tumblr.com/)
	- Place the context of the interaction
		- [PlaceIt](http://placeit.breezi.com/)
	- Don't worry too much about reality. Make it look good.

	



#### Tips on Presenting IxD
**from Hirumi Nanayakkara**


1.	Empathy. Your audience needs to emotionally connect to what you are pitching for you to sell it well. In order to that, you need to tell a really good story. What is the problem that your product is solving? Every great website/digital product tells a compelling story by interweaving thoughtful UI with meaningful interactions and gestures.  

2.	Identify the target demographic-- interview users, create personas, and go through user flows. I find that many people like to skip over this part, but its so so important

3.	Analysis-- competitive and comparative. You should know what is already out there and why your product is better than it, and also things that inspire you

4.	Prioritize features-- list out everything you and your users want your product to do and then prioritize. Designing for mobile first makes this easy, and also helps in cutting out bells + whistles that dont actually make your product better

5.	Wireframe + Prototype-- simple paper prototyping or interactive PDFs can help you figure out what you need to build before wasting a lot of time coding/designing

#### Presentation Skeleton

I wouldn't say this is always the best way to frame a presentation, but this is what made the most sense for us to "sell the sizzle."

1. break down the concept so that its super easy to understand + remember

2. walk through a user scenario--make the audience connect with the app and concept and why its something they could see themselves or someone they know using

3. show that there is a need for this. for this particular concept, we were driven by the horrid gender biases of apps designed for women, and the few apps that we found to be inspiring

4. we then used real world data to show that validated our thinking

5. then it was time to show that there is a real world interest in the world of gardening--this touched on bigger concepts in digital gaming including the success of social responsibility in games like farmville, and also eco-feminism

6. then we talked about all the parameters we needed to meet for the class

7. then walked through the app interface

8. and validated our concept through showing interviews with people that would potentially endorse our idea if we won (eyebeam and the UN)

HW
---------------------------------------

1. Read [13 Ways Designers Screw Up Client Presentations](https://medium.com/@monteiro/13-ways-designers-screw-up-client-presentations-51aaee11e28c)

2. **Finish Up Designs**

	Make it happen, folks. Use whatever suggestions you got from class to push your ideas **TO DA MAX**. And remember, if you have an idea of how a user interaction should go, we should see at least one screenshot demonstrating that. Be descriptive, but keep your descriptions related only to the elements of your UI that are interesting/important.
	
	
3. **Make a Presentation**

	You won't have to give a timed, formal presentation, but you should definitely have a good sense of what you want to show and what you want to say. Create a deliberate plan for the order you present your UI features and find ways to smoothly move between each of your apps elements. Don't come to class with just your slides and expect to be able to get full points on this thing!
