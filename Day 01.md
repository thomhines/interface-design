### IxD Presentation

*Quite often, we start doing work without understand what it is we are doing. Let's look at all the different kinds of designers related to our work this term:*

- Can anybody tell me what a Graphic Designer is/does? 
- What about an Interaction Designer?


Definitions of: ([Startups, this is how design works.](http://startupsthisishowdesignworks.com/), via [Hack Design](http://hackdesign.org))

#### Interaction Design
Interaction designers, on the other hand, focus on digital products and interactive software design. Some examples include web apps like Facebook and Pinterest, mobile apps like Tweetbot, and operating systems like OS X. While graphic design is meant to be observed, **interaction design helps humans experience or manipulate software or hardware in order to achieve specific goals** â€“ checking email, withdrawing money from an ATM, or "Liking" a webpage (such as this one!)

#### User Interface Design
User Interface (UI) design is the design of software or websites with the focus on the user's experience and interaction. **The goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible.** Good user interface design puts emphasis on goals and completing tasks, and good UI design never draws more attention to itself than enforcing user goals.

#### User Experience Design
User Experience (UX) design "incorporates aspects of psychology, anthropology, sociology, computer science, graphic design, industrial design and cognitive science. Depending on the purpose of the product, UX may also involve content design disciplines such as communication design, instructional design, or game design." 8
**The goal of UX design is to create a seamless, simple, and useful interaction between a user and a product**, whether it be hardware or software. As with UI design, user experience design focuses on creating interactions designed to meet or assist a user's goals and needs.

#### Information Architecture
Information Architecture's purpose is to provide order, structure and ease of navigation to a system's content.




### Introduce Project 1

#### Examples
- Nicole Worthington - onboarding
- Ashley Turner - Introducing concepts behind app
- Cindy Sullivan - Vimeo
- Romeo Salazar - Notification Center
- Dillon Lawrence - Animations and nice presentation
- Elizabeth Jackson - Great presentation elements outside of app itself


### Small Groups - [20 min.](http://repeaterrrr.com/YTpia2y)

Split class up into groups of 4-5. Give them 1 minute to pick one type of app off the board and analyze a one-task app, and announce it to the group. They should then take the next 20 minutes to ask and answer these questions:

1. In one sentence, what does this app do?
2. Who is the intended audience?
3. What features actually allow their users to accomplish the thing laid out in question #1?
 

### Regroup and share findings



HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Read Principles of UI Design**

	[Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/) 
	
	Be prepared to talk about this stuff next class! There will be a quiz!


2. **Pick an App for Project 1**

	It can be any app off the list on the Project 1 Brief, or choose your own. You'll probably have the most luck with an app that is similar to something you use/do everyday. **Send your choice to the class email list so that others can see what you are planning to do.**


3. **App Critique**
	
	Find 5 apps that do primarily the same thing as the app you chose for Project 1 (perferrably mobile). List ten interactions/functions/features that you like from these apps and ten that you think are problematic. **Post a link to the app's website, screenshots (when necessary) and your list to the class blog.**
