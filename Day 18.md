=======================================

1. Experience Prototypes
2. Group Crits


PREP
---------------------------------------
- Post Questionnaire to blog


CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Quiz
Based on [Experience Prototyping](http://ideodesign.com.au/images/uploads/news/pdfs/FultonSuriBuchenau-Experience_PrototypingACM_8-00.pdf)


- What are some of the considerations for making an Experience Prototype? 
	- (context, location, time, time constraints, typical user, number of users, relationships between users, etc.)
- What is one of the prototypes discussed in the *Experience Prototyping* article?



### Discuss Readings




#### Experience Prototyping

- What were some of the techniques used?
	- informance (informative performance)
	- bodystorming (brainstorming with your body)
	- Wizards of Oz (the man/woman behind the curtain)
	- replicating physical aspects with improvised materials
	- video
	- beepers to replicate remote signals, 

- Which prototype was the most interesting to you? 
 	- Pacemaker study, people had to use the prototype over time, giving more data. 
 	- Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), controller had to say commands out loud to see how machine/cameraman responded)


**Take 15 minutes to answer these questions**

- Describe what your interface does in 2 sentences or less.
- Who would use your interface?
- What would they hope to gain?
- What is the context/environment in which people will use your interface? Would it be used in public/private? Alone or in groups? 
- What sorts of physical items might a user have to interact with?
- What questions do you need answered about your interface to see if it is necessary or effective?








### Group Crits
I talk to students one-on-one during crits. 
Rotate groups once so everybody can see almost everybody else's ideas




HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Read Chap. 4 of Design of Everyday Things**

	Last reading from this seminal book. We'll discuss it next Monday.


1. **Experience Prototype**

	Using your storyboards as a guide, prototype some aspect of your interface. Whether it is the role, the look and feel, or the implementation, try to figure out what is most important to know about your interface and find out all you can in the shortest amount of time possible. Make sure to get feedback from at least a couple non-designers. Even better, see if you can get feedback from people who are actually in your target demographic.
	
	Make sure to document your tests (photos and text), and post your findings to the blog.
	

1. **Refined Comps**

	Pick your one direction and start making all the comps/slides necessary to show you interface at work. Remember to capture the context and environment that your interface is meant to be used in, and make your affordances clear in your images. These don't have to be 100% complete, but it's better to have more low fidelity images to show your user flow than a few hifi ones.
