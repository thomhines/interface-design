PREP

CLASS
---------------------------------------

### Quiz 

- According to Norman, What are the four kinds of constraints? (Physical, Cultural, Semantic, Logical)
- What are some ways in which we can deal with the physical contraints of a battery? (build them so they can be used in either direction, make it so it's impossible to insert them incorrectly, or make it so that the device itself can handle batteries used in either direction, eg. Microsoft's InstaLoad)

- What is a Forcing Function? (a constraint that prevents people from proceeding until they've met the reqs for the current step, like a car key to start the car)
	- What are the three kinds of functions? (interlocks, lock-ins, and lock-outs)




### Design of Everyday Things, Chap. 4

- What is meant by a physical constraint?
- What are some examples? (batteries, door key, USB)
- Are any of your projects using physical constraints?


- How about Cultural? 
	- Stand facing the rear of the elevator
	- How can this affect your designs (using voice or gestures in public)
	


- Semantic? 
	- Based on meaning
	- Position and orientation of Lego Motorcycle rider
	
- Logical?
	- Process of deduction
	- Blue lego piece is the only one left, so it must go in the last remaining spot

### Evaluations




HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Teacher Evaluations**

	I really want to get better at this stuff, and make a good class for you and future students, so do them. Pretty please. :) 
	

1. **Refined Comps**

	Keep going on your comps. Your presentation next week should tell a story, and your comps need to be able to do most of the work, if not stand on their own. Remember: experience design is about more than just a pretty or clean interface.
