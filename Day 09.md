ART 410 - Day 9
=======================================

1. Review Project 1
3. Review Students' Project Ideas
3. Calm Technology Presentation
4. Discuss Mobile Design


PREP
---------------------------------------
- Post Objectives questions to blog

CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Review Project 1
- What did you think?
- What would you change about your app?
- What did you learn? How can we make interactions more intuitive?
- What would you change about the project?




### Discuss directions chosen by students

- What are you doing your apps on?
- What did you find in your research so far?
- Who do you want to make your app for?



### Objectives Survey

Post these to WordPress:

1. Who is your primary audience? Do you have a secondary one?
2. What are the top three objectives for your app?
3. What are all of the features that related apps have? Are there any that you have thought of on your own? List as many as you can.
4. What is the bare minimum in functionality that your web app should be able to do?
5. What features are unnecessary or don't lead directly to the objectives you listed above?
6. What is your "Call to Action" (The first thing a user should do)?


### BREAK


### Calm Technology Presentation - Briana


### Considerations for Mobile Design (turn this into a presentation)

- Context
	- Short term
	- Distracted
	- Outside/Away
	- Different Kinds of Data
		- Forms - [Examples](http://html5doctor.com/html5-forms-input-types/)
	
- Touch Screens
	- Gestures - [Examples](http://www.mobiletuxedo.com/touch-gesture-icons/)
	- Size - [Device Dimensions](http://stefhatcher.com/projects/device-dimensions/)
	- Easy to reach sections
	- Button Sizes - [Smashing Magazine](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/21/finger-friendly-design-ideal-mobile-touchscreen-target-sizes/)
	
- [Limitations](http://baymard.com/blog/mobile-design-limitations)
	- No Hover State
	- Slow and Error prone typing
	- Less Context (Can't always see what you are doing compared to rest of the screen, esp. when keyboard is up)
	- Inaccurate Clicks
	- Poor Connectivity
	- Slow Hardware
	- Distractability (Other events and notifications can overtake the precedence of your app)

- Extra Features
	- GPS
	- Accelerometer
	- Compass
	- Bluetooth
	- Wifi
	- Camera
	- Proximity Sensor
	- Flashlight
	- Speakers





HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Read this Article on Rapid Prototyping** 
	
	[Design Better, Faster with Rapid Prototyping](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/16/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/)
	
	As much as I've been pounding home the idea of having clear objectives in designing and coding our interfaces, it's just as important to have clear reasons why you are making a particular prototype. This article does a great job of explaining a thoughtful rationale when devising prototyping strategy.


2. **App Design Questionnaire** 	
	Answer these questions and post them to the blog:

	1. Who is your primary audience? Do you have a secondary one?
	2. What are the top three objectives for your app?
	3. What are all of the features that related apps have? Are there any that you have thought of on your own? List as many as you can.
	4. What is the bare minimum in functionality that your web app should be able to do?
	5. What features are unnecessary or don't lead directly to the objectives you listed above?
	6. What is your "Call to Action" (The first thing a user should do)?
	

3. **3 Sets of Wireframes** 	I want to see three distinct directions. You don't have to design the login screens or anything else that you'll see in other apps, but I do want to see the layout and core interactions for the main aspects of your app.
	Consider different layouts, different interactions, and different affordances in each direction. Minimum of 5 frames per direction (15 frames total).
	
	
4. **Bring Android or iDevice to Class**

	Make sure to install [POP](https://popapp.in/) before you come! If you don't have an smart phone, then get [ClickDummy](https://clickdummy.com/) (kind of ugly) or [FieldTest](http://fieldtestapp.com/) (kind of buggy) loaded up in a browser.
