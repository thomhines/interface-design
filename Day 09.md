GREAT work today, folks. It was really fun seeing your presentations, and the apps you made were incredibly smart, innovative and useful. I was very impressed, y'all! Can't wait to see the last few presentations on Thursday!


1. **Recover from Project 1**

	Take a deep breath enjoy the time between projects. I realize some people have to present next class, but at least all of the "work" is done. Enjoy it!


2. **Project Evaluation**
	
	Sometime before next class, I want you to write 2-3 paragraphs on what you thought of Project 1. How did the process feel? What did you learn? Is there anything you're particularly proud of? Is there something you wish you did differently? It's always good to reflect for a few moments when you have the chance, so here's your chance. Post these to the blog.
