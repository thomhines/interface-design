Questions about [Minimizing Complexity In User Interfaces](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/07/minimizing-complexity-in-user-interfaces/)

- If you had to sum up the article we read in a sentence or two, what would it be? (Simplicity and Clarity, similar to week 1's reading)
- What was meant by 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle'? 
- Did anybody like any of the examples listed in the article?  Any other apps or sites that are super simple?

### Crit design comps




HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Design Comps**

	Take what we talked about in class today and keep pushing it. You have one week left, and only one more class session, before we present our final work. Make sure you're ready.

2. **Finish User Flow**

	If you haven't already, make sure you create more comps to explore all of the in-between steps of your site. You should have at least as many comps as it takes for any 20-something year old to understand what's going on without having to hear you explain everything.  These don't have to be finished by Thursday, but be prepared to walk us through each step VISUALLY.
