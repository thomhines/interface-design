### Quiz
([Rapid Prototyping](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/16/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/))

- What is meant by fidelity when it comes to prototypes? 	
	- Can anybody remember what the three aspects of a prototype are that we can test for? (Visual, Functional, Content)
	- What would a low fidelity *visual* prototype look like? High? What about for Functional and Content?
	
- What do you think are the advantages of using high or low fidelity prototypes? (user testing, showing accurate info). 

- Disadvantages? (misleading expectations, too much time spent in wrong direction)

- What are some of the Do's and Don't's from the article?

Do:
> Avoid “prototype creep” by setting expectations for the process, including ones affecting the purpose, fidelity, scope and duration. Remind everyone, including yourself, that rapid prototyping is a means to an end, not an end in itself.

Don't:
> Don’t begin prototype review sessions without clear guidelines for feedback. Be very specific about the type of feedback you are looking for. (Are the steps logically arranged? Is the navigation clear and intuitive?) If not, be prepared for, “I don’t like the blue in the header,” or “Can’t we use this font instead?” or “Can you make this bigger, bolder, in red and flashing?”

### Crit design comps




HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Describe User Flow**

	Write down, step by step, all of the things a typical user will click or do on your site. If you have an image gallery, describe how to get to it and how it works. If you have a special sign-up form, write about that. Make sure that you don't leave anything out. Post this list to WordPress 

2. **Finish User Flow**

	If you haven't already, make sure you create more comps to explore all of the in-between steps of your site. You should have at least as many comps as it takes for any 20-something year old to understand what's going on without having to hear you explain everything.  These don't have to be finished by Thursday, but be prepared to walk us through each step VISUALLY.

3. **Design Comps**

	Take what we talked about in class today and keep pushing it. You have 1.5 weeks left, and only one more class session, before we present our final work. Make sure you're ready.
