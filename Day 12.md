CLASS
---------------------------------------




### Quiz

- What are the two main phases of the double diamond design process? (finding the right problem, finding the right solution)
	- And what are the two phases of each of those phases? (Divergence and convergence)


- How many people does Norman and Jakob Neilson recommend testing your designs with? (5, but make sure to do this often: 5 more with each iteration)
	- Why?


- What is the difference between activity-centered and human-centered design? 
	- What are the advantages of activity centered design? (people change from place to place and culture to culture, but certain tasks and activities tend to stay the same despite that. Designs can have much broader appeal. Norman uses driving as an example. )
	


### Discuss Design of Everyday Things, Chap. 6




- Does any of this reading sound familiar to the process we've started already?
	- Solving the correct problem
	- Double Diamond Design process
	- Human Centered design

		- Apples iPod example
			- Why was it successful? (Because Apple focused on "listening to music", not features or devices)


- Iterative Design vs. linear stages
	- Waterfall (or gated waterfall) design process
		- What is it?
	- Iterative design
		- What is it? (mention Agile or scrum)
	
	- What are the advantages of each? (more control for management, each step is preceded by thorough review and research, clear path)
	- Disadvantages? (cumbersome, slow, always behind, can't adapt)


- Products have multiple, conflicting requirements
	- Who are we designing for? What needs are being addressed? Even if we just choose the end user, we have to be aware of that and of the other stakeholders.
	
- What did you guys learn from the example of the OXO peeler?
	- Designing for edge cases (special people), can actually make products that are more usable by anybody
		
	> The best solution to the problem of designing for everyone is flexibility: flexibility in the size of the images on computer screens, in the sizes, heights, and angles of tables and chairs.



- Complexity Is Good; It Is Confusion That Is Bad
	> Complex things are no longer complicated once they are understood.



*From previous edition:*

- What are some of the ways that designers go astray, according to Norman? (Putting aesthetics first, designers are not typical users, designers design for clients who isn't the user)






### Presentations
- Shaun Inman: Charlie

	- Designer as author
		- Shaun has created a number of apps like Mint and Fever that address a specific need through design, much like you guys are doing.
		- He describes Fever as 'opinionated software', by which he means that it's meant to be a panacea. It's his take on how an RSS feed reader should be, and it has a lot of limitations. Even so, it is wildly popular.
		
	- Game Design as User Design
	


- Calm Technology/Ubiquitous Computing: Briana
	- How does this tie into Project 2?
	- Do any of your projects 




### Discuss Designs






HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Rough Sketches**

	Based on the discussions we had in class, pick three of your "solutions" and start to fill in the details about them. Take notes, make sketches, and put together your thoughts on how these solutions could really work. Post everything to the blog. 
	
2. **Rough Comps**

	After you've explored the concepts a little bit more in depth, pick one "solution" and start to mock up your ideas in a visual form. If you are making something that is more of a UI, start creating the screens for that. If you are making something that is physical or environmental, start looking at what form it will take and picking out contexts for it. Do whatever you have to do in order to help us see your solution in its best light.
