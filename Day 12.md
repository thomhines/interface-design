### Quiz
Based on UI Design Best Practices, [Chap. 3](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/UI%20Design%20Best%20Practices,%20Chap.%203.pdf)
	
- What is a persona?
- What sorts of information should we create for our personas? (Name, job, hobbies, interested, fears, aspirations, age, gender, etc.)
- What are some considerations to make when creating user scenarios? (the user's environment, what they are doing, triggering events and actions, persona behavior: what do they value and what are their responses?)



### Discuss Personas


- Did anybody use the personas to create their user flows?
- Which persona did your user flow most connect with?
- Is there anything in your user flow that would turn off one or more of your personas?
- How can you involve the other personas by modifying your user flows?


### Discuss Designs
Split students into groups of 4, discuss personas and ideas for solutions to their problems



### Work Session

While I meet 1-on-1 with students






HW
---------------------------------------

Big day today, guys! Lots of big decisions made, lots of progress on your concepts, and lots of great discussions within groups. For those of you who weren't here today, we decided to combine Project 2 and Project 3, so that we now have until the end of the term to finish these things. Project 3 focuses on experimental/non-standard interfaces (eg. augmented reality, gestural interfaces, etc.), which many of you will be presenting on next week. These will be integrated into the designs you guys have already begun.

Since we haven't talked about these things yet, focus on outlining clear user flows through storyboards and begin to develop an aesthetic direction for your UI. This could manifest itself in a number of different ways, so play around with different ideas and try to be as divergent as possible at this stage. We have a few extra weeks to get through all of this, so you always have time to change your mind later, if you feel like you're getting stuck.

Below is your homework for the next week. Remember, we don't have class on Tuesday, so you have until Thursday to get all of this done!

Have a great week, everyone! Can't wait to see what you come up with!


1. **Storyboards**

	Create a storyboard for each of your personas. Show us what it's like for that specific person to deal with your chosen location. What do they have to do? How is your UI making it easier? Some of these might overlap a little, at which point you can focus on different details for each person. If your personas are too similar or if they're objectives don't allow for some flexbility in your user flow, consider making them a bit more diverse.


2. **Wireframes**

	Plan out the actual UI, and how you might organize information at different points in the process. You'll use these to help you create your design comps. Now that we are looking at using non-standard interfaces, consider what it would be like to have your UI built into walls, clothes, watches, books, doors, lamps, glasses, speakers, etc. For this, you are especially freed from the constraints of reality.


3. **Design Comps**

	After you've explored the concepts a little bit more in depth, start to mock up your ideas in a visual form. I want to see 3 distinct aesthetic/layout directions. If you are making something that is more of a screen-based UI, start creating the screens for that. If you are making something that is physical or environmental, start looking at what form it will take and picking out contexts for it. Do whatever you have to do in order to help us see your solution in its best light. Post these, along with any questions or comments that might help elicit good feedback to the blog.
